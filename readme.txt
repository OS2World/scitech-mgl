                       Getting Started Guide


What is this document for?
--------------------------

This text document is intended to be a brief overview to help
developers determine which files to download to get started. This
document is *NOT* intended as a readme file to get you started
installing and using the SciTech MGL. For complete documentation on
installing and using the SciTech MGL, please refer to the online
HTML documentation pages found here:

Installing the files
--------------------

The SciTech MGL requires the SciTech SNAP Graphics SDK in order to
access the underlying graphics hardware device. Hence to install
the SciTech MGL, you will need to first install and configure the
SciTech SNAP SDK. To install the files, at a minimum you will need
a copy of the SciTech SNAP SDK source archive, the SciTech SNAP SDK
base utilities archive for your OS, the SciTech SNAP device driver
binaries, the MGL source archive and the font and bitmap resource
archives. Uncompress all files in the archives into the directory
on your system where you want the files to live (normally c:\scitech
or ~/scitech for Unix). You can optionally install the source code
for the base archive utilities as well as the MGL documentation
in HTML format (for offline browsing). The names of the archives
included in this release are:

Connecting with Perforce
------------------------

All of the source code for the SciTech MGL is managed by a public
software repository, using the commercial Perforce version management
system. Perforce Software has graciously allowed Open Source software
projects to be able to use a free server license for that source code.

If you wish to connect with Perforce, you can download a copy of the
entire public depot at the time the release was made. This contains a
lot more files than is distributed in the files listed above, but is
useful if you wish to avoid doing a large initial sync. You will need
one of the following files depending on the platform you are using, and
you will not need *any* of the files listed above:

 full_depot_r23.zip              - Complete copy of GPL depot in DOS/Win format
 full_depot_r23.tar.gz           - Complete copy of GPL depot in Unix format

For complete instruction on how to get connected via Perforce, please
refer to the full SciTech MGL documentation found here:
